Go is a statically typed, compiled high-level programming language designed at Google[12] by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson.[13] It is syntactically similar to C, but also has memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing,[7] and CSP-style concurrency.[14] It is often referred to as Golang because of its former domain name, golang.org, but its proper name is Go.
